# Week5-Challenges

1. Let's create a class. I created one called 'Employee'.

This should feel familiar. The syntax in the first line is similar to function definitions. Make your own class, use capital case for the name of your class. 

2. Create 3 objects of your class.

3. This point you should have 3 objects. Each is an instance of your class. What type are they? write code to print the type of each of your objects.
4. Write code that prints the types you have already encountered? Print out at least 4 different types.
5. OK, so your class isn't really doing much. Let's add some attributes.

You should add at least 5 attributes to your class. Think of attributes as facts about each instance of the class you created. In my case, each employee has number, name, department, supervisor, and salary.

6. How would you go about printing these attributes? The same way you print variables. One slight difference is the ".", the format should look like this: 'object name.attribute'. Write code that will print the first attribute of all the objects you created.
